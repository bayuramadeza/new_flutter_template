# New Flutter Template

The Flutter team has tasked me with creating a new template for Flutter. This
repo will house all of the work-in-progress documentation and code to support
this effort!

## Flutter Version

When different folks work on a Flutter project together, it's important everyone
uses the same version of Flutter to avoid any version conflicts.

To achieve that goal, this project uses
[`fvm`](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm). Please install and run all commands
through `fvm` and [configure your IDE to use
fvm](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm#configure-your-ide) to use the correct
version of Flutter defined by `fvm`.

### Example

``` fvm flutter pub get ```
